# Contrast Over Contradiction

I explored this idea in a recent conversation with someone, and wound up posting about it on Instagram. I wanted to note what I wrote there over here in case I decided to expand on it more:
> Probably the most interesting part of any convo I had today was a discussion about "parts", as in, parts of ourselves.
> Sometimes we feel (or at least I feel) like there's no way the parts of me that express themselves can logically coexist with other parts. I was viewing those parts as if they're contradictory to, or mutually exclusive with, others.
>
> Today I talked with someone about viewing those parts which seem at odds with each other more from the lens of "contrast" than "contradiction". When it comes to colors in an image/painting, contrast enhances the overall effect of the final work by bringing out meaningful visual distinctions.
>
> Contrasts can be complimentary, whereas contradiction feels very black-and-white. It is practically a small change in language but it shifts the attitude I take towards these things away from rigidity/shaming and opens up into a space/attitude of acceptance.

I don't know why exactly I have such a preoccupation with the idea that we contain multitudes, and that we can struggle to find a sense of harmony amidst the discordant sounds of all our inner voices. Part of me thinks it's important for me to embrace this idea because it's what I want reassurance of myself. I see such variability in my perceptions and reactions to reality at times that to embrace a consistent sense of identity over time feels like an insurmountable task.

It's possible that all of this is just a form of obsessing and ruminating in an attempt to obtain certainty about the "true" nature of my identity and personhood. It's always been something which has felt elusive, which seems strange to say considering that I've been with myself my whole life. How can _I_ hide from _myself_, I ask? And yet, I do.

At its worst, the question, "Who am I?" is an anxiety-inducing rabbit hole in which my brain literally draws a blank and can't seem _at all_ to remember or think of relevant things which might help me answer such an open-ended question. It feels almost as if my mind shuts down because it's terrified of the uncertainty around choosing a coherent self-definition. To choose to be something feels like choosing not to be so many other worthwhile things, and somehow that sense of fundamental limitation produces a hand wringing at the universe, writ large. But, the more I get into my body, and the more I engage with the world outside of pure thought, the more I understand how unique the gift of my own subjective experience of life really is. I won't get any of this time or these moments back.
